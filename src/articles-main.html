                        <p>Если начать разговор с самой <a href="#">Черногории</a>, то история страны весьма насыщенна. Изначально ее территорию населяли иллирийские племена, потом она перешла под власть Римской империи. Но свой след в истории и культуре страны оставили и французы, и турки, и австро-венгры, и <strong>венецианцы</strong>. В общем, страна вобрала в себя ото всех по чуть-чуть.</p>
                        <p>Одним из самых красивых мест является залив Бока, который формируют четыре залива: Которский, Рисанский, Тиватский и Херцег-Новский. На берегу Которского залива стоит город Пераст, где когда-то располагался венецианский флот, насчитывавший 1000 кораблей, там же находится главная достопримечательность города — морской музей. Неподалеку расположен Котор — город с прекрасно сохранившейся древней архитектурой, на чьих крепостных стенах протяженностью в четыре километра по ночам загорается вереница огней, буквально идущих в небо.</p>
                        <p>Кстати, в Черногории находятся объекты Всемирного наследия ЮНЕСКО: сам город Котор и весь Которский залив, а также национальный парк «Дурмитор». На протяжении многих столетий Которский залив был оживленным портом, в который стекались корабли венецианских купцов, следовавших на восток. В конце XIX века в Тивате был основан военный порт. На его территории сейчас и расположен Porto Montenegro.</p>
